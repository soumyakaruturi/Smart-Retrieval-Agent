# 🚀Smart RAG Agent

InsightRAG is an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework enhanced with **reasoning capabilities**. Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply retrieve documents and generate responses, InsightRAG introduces a **reasoning layer** that allows the model to think step-by-step, improving accuracy, reliability, and explainability.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔎 **Intelligent Retrieval** – Finds the most relevant documents using vector search.
* 🧠 **Reasoning-Enhanced LLM** – Performs multi-step reasoning before generating answers.
* 🤖 **Agentic Workflow** – Dynamically decides when to retrieve, summarize, or generate.
* 📚 **Context-Aware Answers** – Provides precise and well-grounded responses from your data.
* ⚡ **Modular & Extensible** – Easy to adapt for research, chatbots, or knowledge systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Document Ingestion** → Texts are embedded and stored in a vector database.
2. **Query Processing** → User queries are transformed into embeddings.
3. **Retrieval** → Top-k relevant chunks are fetched.
4. **Reasoning Layer** → The agent evaluates retrieved information step-by-step.
5. **Response Generation** → A refined, context-aware answer is returned.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the reasoning RAG agent:

```bash
python rag_reasoning_agent.py
```

Example query:

```
User: What are the key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning?  
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

```
Retrieved Documents: 3  
Reasoning Steps:  
1. Retrieved definitions of supervised and unsupervised learning  
2. Compared based on labeled data and algorithm goals  
3. Summarized differences  

Final Answer:  
Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train models for prediction, while unsupervised learning identifies hidden patterns in unlabeled data.  
```

## 📌 Use Cases

* Academic research assistants
* Legal / Medical / Finance document QA
* Knowledge-based reasoning systems
* AI-powered tutoring or consulting tools

---

## 🛠️ Roadmap

* [ ] Add support for multiple vector databases
* [ ] Improve reasoning with chain-of-thought prompts
* [ ] Deploy with Streamlit/Gradio frontend
* [ ] Enable evaluation metrics (accuracy, faithfulness)

Would you like me to also **add a diagram of the architecture** (retrieval → reasoning → generation) so your README looks more professional on GitHub?
